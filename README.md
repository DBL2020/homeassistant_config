## simple automation to optimize EV charging with Photovoltaics power (PV Ãœberschussladen)
I was looking for a simple way to maximize EV charging with unused PV power. I tried some dedicated software, but finally a very simple homeassistant automation does it well.

- 6 A = 4 kW
- 8 A = 6 kW
- 10 A = 7 kW
- 12 A = 8 kW
- 14 A = 10 kW
- 16 A = 11 kW

### Prerequisites
1. Integration PV smartmeter with PV power surplus, example Fronius smartmeter, variable pvueb showing kW unused (https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/fronius/)
2. Integration Wallbox: here keba P30, common model DE440 (https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/keba/)

### Configuration
pvueb: current kWh power surplus (negativ means getting power from grid).

### Automation
- sonne_tanken_ein: 
When enabled, the automation is scheduled for every 10 minutes to either enable wallbox and set initial ampere setting (initial_ampere) or to change ampere setting when already in charging mode (change_ampere). Only starts if sun is above horizon of course.

### scripts
- intial_ampere: if not charging, sets the initial ampere setting and enables wallbox
- change_ampere: if charging, changes ampere setting or disables charging depending on PV power surplus
